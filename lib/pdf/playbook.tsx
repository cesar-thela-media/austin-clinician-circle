          <Text style={s.sectionTagline}>Stop undercharging — and stop apologizing for what you're worth.</Text>
        </View>

        <Text style={s.p}>
          Most therapists set their fees too low. Not because they don't know their value, but because they've been conditioned to apologize for it. This section gives you a systematic way to set fees that reflect the true cost of your work — and hold them.
        </Text>

        <Text style={s.h2}>Step 1 — Calculate your true hourly cost</Text>
        <Text style={s.p}>
          Before you set a client-facing rate, calculate what one clinical hour actually costs you to deliver. Include: your time in session, documentation (typically 20–30 min per hour), administrative overhead, continuing education amortized monthly, liability insurance, EHR and billing software, office rent or platform fees, and unpaid no-shows or late cancellations at your current rate.
        </Text>
        <NumItem n={1} text="Track your actual billable hours vs. total hours worked this month." />
        <NumItem n={2} text="Add up all fixed monthly practice costs (rent, software, insurance, phone)." />
        <NumItem n={3} text="Divide total cost by billable hours — this is your floor. Your rate must exceed it." />

        <Text style={s.h2}>Step 2 — Know your local market ceiling</Text>
        <Text style={s.p}>
          In the Austin metro, licensed therapist rates currently range from $140–$250/hr for individual therapy, with specialists (EMDR, IFS, trauma) regularly billing $175–$275. If you're below $150, you're likely underpriced relative to your training and licensure.
        </Text>

        <View style={s.goldBox}>
          <Text style={s.goldBoxTitle}>The $30 Raise Rule</Text>
          <Text style={s.goldBoxText}>
            If no prospective client has pushed back on your fee in the last 6 months, your rate is too low. Raise it by $30 for all new clients. Give existing clients 60 days' notice. You will not lose them all — and the ones who leave at $30 were not your clients anyway.

      <Page size="A4" style={s.page}>
        <Text style={s.h2}>Step 3 — The sliding scale decision framework</Text>
        <Text style={s.p}>
          Sliding scale is a values decision, not a default. Before offering reduced fees, decide in advance: How many reduced-fee slots will I hold at any one time? What is my floor? What documentation or process will I use?
        </Text>
        <NumItem n={1} text="Decide your hard floor — the minimum you will accept for any session — and write it down." />
        <NumItem n={2} text="Limit reduced-fee slots to no more than 20% of your caseload unless it's a core part of your mission." />
        <NumItem n={3} text="Consider a brief financial screening so you're giving reduced fees to clients who genuinely need them." />
        <NumItem n={4} text="Revisit reduced-fee clients annually. Circumstances change." />

        <Text style={s.h2}>Step 4 — Communicating fees without apology</Text>
        <Text style={s.p}>
          The language you use to discuss fees signals your relationship to your own value. Compare:
        </Text>
        <View style={s.callout}>
          <Text style={s.calloutText}>
            ✗ "I know it's a lot... my rate is $175... but I do have some sliding scale if that's a problem."{"\n\n"}
            ✓ "My rate is $175 per session. Do you have questions about that before we continue?"
          </Text>
        </View>
        <Text style={s.p}>
          The second version is complete. It does not pre-emptively apologize. It invites dialogue from a place of stability. Practice this phrasing until it feels neutral — because it is.
        </Text>

        <Text style={s.h3}>When to raise existing client rates</Text>
        <Text style={s.p}>
          The answer is: regularly. Annual increases of $10–$20 are expected, professional, and appropriate. Give written notice 60 days in advance. A brief, warm letter works well: "As of [date], my rate for new and existing clients will be $[amount]. I value our work together and want to let you know well in advance."

          Burnout in therapists rarely arrives as a single dramatic event. It accumulates — small erosions in boundary, motivation, and presence that, over months, become chronic. The checklist below is designed for early detection, not crisis response.
        </Text>
        <Text style={s.p}>
          Check any item you've experienced more than twice in the past 30 days. Three or more checked items is a signal worth taking seriously.

        <Text style={s.h2}>Clinical signs</Text>
        <CheckItem text="You find yourself clock-watching during sessions more than once per week." />
        <CheckItem text="You've noticed yourself mentally rehearsing what you'll say instead of listening." />
        <CheckItem text="You feel relief when a client cancels rather than neutral or mild disappointment." />
        <CheckItem text="You've had difficulty recalling details of a client's case you know well." />

        <Text style={s.h2}>Relational and boundary signs</Text>
        <CheckItem text="You've said yes to a scheduling request that crossed a boundary you've set in the past." />
        <CheckItem text="You've responded to a client text or email outside your stated availability more than twice in the past month." />
        <CheckItem text="You've noticed yourself being less honest in supervision or consultation than you'd want a supervisee to be." />
        <CheckItem text="You've taken on a client outside your specialty or scope because you didn't want to disappoint them." />

        <Text style={s.h2}>Personal and systemic signs</Text>
        <CheckItem text="Work conversations dominate your social interactions even when you're 'off.'" />
        <CheckItem text="You're using alcohol, food, screens, or exercise in ways that feel compensatory rather than nourishing." />

          This is a signal. Don't wait. Take one concrete action this week: reduce caseload by one client, add a supervision appointment, book a personal therapy session, or restructure one persistent boundary violation.

          You are likely already in secondary trauma or clinical burnout. This is not a character failing — it is occupational injury. Stop adding clients. Seek consultation or personal therapy immediately. Consider whether a caseload reduction is necessary for client safety as much as your own.

          <Text style={s.goldBoxTitle}>The Most Protective Structure Known</Text>
          <Text style={s.goldBoxText}>
            Research consistently shows that peer consultation — regular, structured, honest clinical consultation with colleagues — is the single most protective factor against burnout in licensed therapists. Not self-care in the conventional sense. Community. That's what ACC is built for.

        <Text style={s.p}>
          After ten years in private practice and six years running peer consultation groups, Sarah Arnold identified a consistent pattern: the therapists who built sustainable, fulfilling practices weren't the most experienced, the most credentialed, or the best at marketing. They were the ones who stayed connected.

        <Text style={s.h2}>What thriving practices have in common</Text>
        <NumItem n={1} text="They consult regularly — not just on crisis cases, but as a standing practice habit. Weekly or biweekly consultation is the norm, not the exception." />
        <NumItem n={2} text="They refer generously — because they have a network they trust, they can place clients well rather than holding them past fit." />
        <NumItem n={3} text="They keep learning — not just CEUs for license renewal, but trainings they actually want to take because they're curious." />
        <NumItem n={4} text="They talk about money — fees, billing, overhead — with peers. The stigma around pricing in the helping professions is real and actively harmful." />
        <NumItem n={5} text="They have at least one person who knows their full caseload and practice reality. Not just a supervisor — a peer." />

        <Text style={s.h2}>The isolation tax</Text>
        <Text style={s.p}>
          Working in isolation has a compounding cost that rarely shows up on a ledger. It shows up as: lower fees (no benchmark), worse referrals (no network), slower clinical growth (no consultation), and earlier burnout (no community). Call it the isolation tax.
